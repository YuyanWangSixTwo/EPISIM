Title: Partial Linear Single Index Models for Environmental mixture analysis
Description: This packacge includes a family of Partial Linear Single Index Models for Environmental mixture analyses (EPLSIM), which currently provides functions for scalar outcomes. The outputs of these functions include the single index function, single index coefficients, confounder coefficients, mixture overall effect, exposure main and interaction effects, and interquartile effects.  In the future, we will add functions for binary, ordinal, Poisson, survival, and longitudinal outcomes, as well as models for time-dependent exposures.
